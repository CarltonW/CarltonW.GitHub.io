<div>
    I'm a full-stack software engineer specializing in the ASP.NET framework in both Visual Basic and C#. 
    I also work on Mobile Application development using both the Xamarin.Forms framework and Apache Cordova framework depending on the project. 
    I'm well-versed in JavaScript and many of it's popular libraries and frameworks.

    I brew beer and play golf in my free time.
