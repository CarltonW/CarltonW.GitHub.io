Most of the time when we hang out with friends we ask “You want to go grab a bite to eat?” Well, that’s all fine and dandy, but one of the best ways to really spend time with friends is by making a dish you’ve never made before *with* your friends. Use ingredients you’ve never used, make something homemade you’ve never had before. It’s quite fun.

Here is a video of my friends and I making pork Chateaubriand with red wine sauce, french onion soup, and homemade cinnamon rolls for dessert.
