DailyUI challenge 002 - Design a credit card checkout form or page. Did this one without a wire-framing tool - instead opted to just use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I only worked on it for about an hour, so I'm not too upset with the results. The card type icon (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, etc. does change depending on the start of the card number).

Things I could improve on:
 - The fonts are pretty ugly, I'd like to spend more time browsing available fonts.
 - Responsiveness. Because this was just part of a challenge and not production code, I did not consider mobile viewing in the design.
