A little over a year ago, I married my wife. For our anniversary, we sat down and edited our honeymoon video together. It took about three days to get it done, but it was an experience for us, and we got to relive our honeymoon experiences through the process.

The video is long. 1 hour and 52 minutes. It could have been cut down to parts that were particularly interesting rather than just every bit of video we took in Ireland, but then there would have been some of the simple memories lost.

We hope you enjoy the video if you decide to watch. Grab the popcorn! üçø
