A few weeks back, Brooklyn and I hiked the North side of the W.G. Jones State Forest. Itâ€™s a small park with few small trails. Itâ€™s certainly nothing amazing, but it was a good little escape from buildings, cars, and stop lights. We did some geocaching, some Pokemon Go, and just enjoyed our day in the sun.
