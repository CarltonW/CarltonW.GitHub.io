There’s nothing quite like presenting your screen to an audience of important people or to a group of your coworkers during a meeting and having an email come through from Mint with the subtitle 

> “You’ve spent $300 this month on Pubs & Bars”.

Let’s fix that. Assuming you’re on Windows, there is a great built in feature that is surprisingly underutilized that we can enable when presenting or demoing our app for a client called “Presentation Mode”. Now, this is nothing new — presentation mode has been around since Vista, it just seems to me like nobody every enables it, likely because they don’t know how.

# Why activate Windows Presentation Mode?
When Windows Presentation Mode is active, your machine won’t automatically go to sleep and all of system notifications will be temporarily turned off until you disable presentation mode. You can also set a specific Presentation Mode wallpaper and adjust the speaker volume specifically for presentations. Those settings will be automagically applied when you activate Presentation Mode.

# How to activate Windows Presentation Mode
Okay, step one.
1. Press the Windows Key + X to bring up the Power User Menu .
2. Either press “b” or select the “Mobility Center” option on the list. At the time of writing this article, the option is second on the list.
3. In the “Presentation Settings” tile, press the “Turn On” button. This will activate Presentation Mode and trigger any custom Presentation Settings you have.

Note — settings can be changed by running presentationsettings.exe. Just type that in the Start Search bar if you’re not sure where it is.
And that’s it! It’s very simple and to the point, but it seems like almost nobody uses it.
