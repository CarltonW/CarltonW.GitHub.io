If you are looking for an excellent WiFi solution then I would recommend the  Ubiquiti's NanoHD Access Points. I've installed many of these in my small offices without issues. For most installations one access point is enough, but if you need extra coverage it's as easy as enabling a switch on the setup.

For anyone who maintains remote locations you would expect that there is a cloud based management solution. Unfortunately, there is not with the Ubiquiti line of access points. With that said once you setup an AP there isn't any maintenance. Firmware upgrades can be done from a system on the system on the same subnet using the Unifi Controller software.

In this tutorial I will go over how to setup the Unifi Controller software and how to backup and restore the site configuration onto a system on the local subnet where the AP will be installed.
